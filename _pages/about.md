Hi, my name is Javier Pelayo, born in Zaragoza, Spain.

I've been Java developer the most part of my career, lately pivoting into engineering management. I am passionate about clean code and devops principle. During the latest years working more as platform engineer, especialist in event driven architectures and streaming as integration patterns.

On the personal note, I am lucky of having multiple topics that I try to squeeze on my spare time: cycling, going to the mountain, soccer (c'mon Real Zaragoza), videogames, tv shows.... quite restless.

I love to keep learning :)
